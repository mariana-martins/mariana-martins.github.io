    "question" : "​What is the book that most influenced you in IT career? [+]",
    "answer" : "​The book that most influenced me was 'Web for Everyone'. I've always found the subject of accessibility very interesting, but this book opened my eyes about how disabled users use websites. Most people when they talk about accessibility refer to blind and deaf people, but they omit other disabilities as dyslexia and color blindness. So this book helped me to understand how different types of disabilities influence the way of coding a website."

    "question" : "​Which is a language or a framework that you would like to be a specialist in the future? [+]",
    "answer" : "​I think it would be JavaScript. Although I’m studying and improving about this language, I'm far from being an expert on the subject. However, I believe this language is one of the most important for the profession I chose. JavaScript is the most applied language in the world and anyone who wants to be a good front-end developer needs to know this language very well."

    "question" : "​What is your favorite language, framework or library? [+]",
    "answer" : "​I really like Bootstrap. It helps to create websites faster. Bootstrap components allow to create basic layout websites in minutes. Also, grid system is required in any good website, so using Bootstrap's grid system makes the developer's life much easier. Therefore, it is simple to have a responsive application using Bootstrap. Another important point is: it's documentation is objective and easy to use. The Bootstrap users are a big community, thus it is easier to find solutions for problems by consulting other people."
