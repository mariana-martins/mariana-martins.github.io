## Introduction
This is my personal website. It was made using [Gatsby Starter Stellar](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-stellar)

## Installing and running

You are going to need Node.js previous installed in your PC. Before running, you need to install all dependencies using the
following command line:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run this project using the following command line:

```
gatsby develop
```

It will start a webserver at port `8000`, which reloads automatically
if there're changes on the source code.

If you want to generate all files to deploy on production, use the
following command line:

```
npm run build
```

It will generate the whole application on `public` folder.  `index.html`
is the main html file.

Currently, this application runs in production through
_Github Pages_.
