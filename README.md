## Introduction
This is my personal website. 
It contains relevant projects, 
my articles and some questions about me. 

## How to Run

Before running, you need to install all dependencies using the
following command line:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run this project using the following command line:

```
npm run start
```

It will start a webserver at port `8080`, which reloads automatically
if there're changes on the source code.

If you want to generate all files to deploy on production, use the
following command line:

```
npm run build
```

It will generate the whole application on `dist` folder.  `index.html`
is the main html file.  You can use this application in a static file
server.  Currently, this application runs in production through
_Github Pages_.
