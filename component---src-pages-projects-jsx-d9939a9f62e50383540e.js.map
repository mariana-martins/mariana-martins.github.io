A question with two options is going to be\n            displayed and a user needs to choose one option. The user is not\n            allowed to select both options or any option. Users can create new\n            questions and verify his/her score on the Leaderboard page. It shows\n            how many questions users answered and how many questions users\n            created.

The propose of this project was to exercise\n            the knowledge about React through components, state, props, etc.\n            Udacity provided to me a layout already done and I had to create a\n            bookshelf app that allows an user to categorize books using some\n            categories. Another mandatory functionality for the project was a\n            limited search feature. An user could search a pre-determined term\n            on that search and books related to that query have to display on\n            the page.\n          </p>\n          <h2>\n            <a href=\"https://github.com/mariana-martins/contact-app\">\n              <i className=\"fas fa-hashtag\" />\n              &nbsp;Contact Map App\n            </a>\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            I developed a single-page application that is a Contact List. Main\n            features are to add a new contact on the list, favorite a contact,\n            display the contact list and update the contact information. The\n            data is saved on the browser localStorage. I used React, Material UI\n            and Jest to implement this project and Netlify to host.
